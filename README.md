# Master Thesis data
This repository contains the data used in my MSc thesis titled "Temperature dependence of soil microbial processes: model evaluation and theoretical basis". 

# Description
Soil microorganisms are of high importance for determining the response of ecosystems to 
climate change, as they govern fluxes of carbon (C) in and out of the soil. Soil microorganisms 
take up C from soil organic matter and use it to build products which are not easily 
decomposed, through microbial growth. In doing so, soil microbes mitigate the effects of 
climate change. Simultaneously, soil microbes use C to gain energy, through microbial 
respiration, where CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere, contributing to the effects of climate 
change. To give insight in how much C is used for growth and how much is respired, the 
parameter Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) is used. CUE is considered as a key parameter in 
models, as it conceptually links growth and respiration. Microbial growth and respiration are 
heavily dependent on temperature. Currently, models, which try to represent these 
relationships, do not conceptually link microbial growth and respiration, thereby not improving 
our theoretical understanding. Additionally, current models can not be used to reflect long-term 
thermal adaptation of soil microorganisms to shifting thermal regimes. This thesis aims to 
improve our theoretical understanding by presenting a new model: the MMRT_D. To explore if 
and how the model describes growth, respiration and CUE, two different calibration approaches 
are used. The model includes a new formulation, based on the Macro-molecular rate theory 
(MMRT), where microbial growth and respiration are conceptually linked. The fit, parsimony and 
parameter relationship with temperatures are determined and compared to established models 
(MMRT, Walker model and Huang model). However, it is not yet able to show an improved fit to 
the data and parsimony, where future research could improve this. Additionally, the new model 
could be better used to reflect long-term thermal adaptation of soil microorganisms to shifting 
thermal regimes. This thesis shows that the new model improves our theoretical understanding 
of the temperature dependence of soil microbial process through the link between growth and 
respiration. This leads to a better understanding of how soil microbes govern C fluxes, thereby 
giving more accurate estimations of the response of ecosystem to climate change.
