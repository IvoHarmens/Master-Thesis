# Master Thesis data
This repository contains the data used in my MSc thesis titled "Temperature dependence of soil microbial processes: model evaluation and theoretical basis". 

# Description


# Content
This repository  consists of the following:<br />
[EuropeanGradientData.xlsx]: Dataset from Cruz-Paredes et al. (2023) including microbial growth rates, microbial respiration rates and the Mean Annual Soil Temperature (MAST) for 70 sites around Europe. 
[Script_IvoHarmens_MSc_EarthSciences]: Matlab script with the code which generated the results and figures


# Usage
If you find my data useful, feel free to use it. When using this data, please consider citing my thesis:
